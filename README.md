## Project Overview:

The project involved a team of skilled data science trainees. Together, we explored the dataset, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), performed feature engineering, built predictive models using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, and evaluated model performance to develop accurate price estimation models for diamonds.

## Key Highlights:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We delved deep into the dataset, uncovering insights into the distribution, correlation, and significance of various diamond attributes.
- Feature Engineering: Through meticulous feature engineering, we derived new attributes to enhance the predictive power of our models, including geometric properties, ratios, and categorical feature encoding.
- Model Building: Leveraging popular machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, RandomForest, and Gradient Boosting, we developed robust predictive models capable of accurately estimating diamond prices.
- Performance Evaluation: We rigorously evaluated model performance using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure the reliability and accuracy of our predictions.

## Programming Language Used:

This project is primarily developed using Python.
